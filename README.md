# MQTT/TLS Playground

This repository contains a bunch of scripts that estabilish MQTT-with-TLS connections
to an MQTT broker running on `localhost:8883` using various clients.

It is of no use to anyone but the people who work on MQTT brokers and/or MQTT-aware
proxies.

## Available Examples

 * [ruby with mqtt gem](./ruby-mqtt)
 * [paho python](./python-paho)

## How to Generate TLS Certificates and Keys for Development

Just use [tls-gen](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/tls-gen).
